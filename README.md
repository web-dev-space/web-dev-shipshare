# ShipShare Web Devlopment

Our Website: https://shipshare.netlify.app


## Introduction

In recent years, the demand for international products has grown significantly, but shipping costs remain a significant obstacle for most people. Shipping companies charge high prices due to the small size of shipments, which makes shipping economically unfeasible for many consumers. This situation has created a market gap that ShipShare aims to address. 

ShipShare is a revolutionary platform that provides an affordable solution for international shipping by leveraging group buying power. The platform enables consumers to join a group with other members to purchase and share the cost of international shipping. 

Traditionally, when individuals want to purchase goods from abroad, they have to find a shipping company to deliver the goods to the US, which can be very costly. For instance, the shipping cost for one kilogram of goods from China to the US is approximately $50. However, with ShipShare, consumers can combine their shipments with others and share the shipping cost, resulting in a substantial reduction in individual shipping expenses. Then they just need to pay aroun $5 per kilogram of goods.
